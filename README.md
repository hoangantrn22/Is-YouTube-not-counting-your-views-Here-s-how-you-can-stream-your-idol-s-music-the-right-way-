## Why YouTube Doesnâ€™t Count Your Views?

YouTube has strict algorithms in place to prevent fake views from skewing video engagement data. This includes detecting when the same IP address watches a video repeatedly, which can trigger YouTubeâ€™s anti-bot filters. Essentially, if a single IP address generates too many views from the same account or video, YouTube will stop counting them to avoid artificially inflated view counts.

So, if youâ€™ve been refreshing your video repeatedly or using a single device to watch the video over and over, YouTube will likely ignore those views. This can be frustrating, especially if you're trying to support your idolâ€™s latest track.

## What Are Rotating Proxies, and Why Should You Use Them?

A **proxy** serves as an intermediary between your device and the internet, masking your actual IP address. This is helpful for privacy, security, and bypassing regional restrictions. However, a **rotating proxy** goes a step furtherâ€”it changes your IP address periodically or after each request. By rotating IPs, you can appear as different users watching the video from different locations and devices.

Why is this important for YouTube? YouTubeâ€™s algorithms track IP addresses to prevent bots from inflating view counts. By using rotating proxies, you mimic the behavior of multiple real users, ensuring that your views appear organic and are counted by YouTube.

## How to Buff Your YouTube Music Video Views Using 9Proxy's Rotating Proxies

Hereâ€™s how you can use **9Proxyâ€™s rotating proxies** to safely and effectively boost views on your idol's music video:

### Step 1: Log in to the 9Proxy Website

Start by visiting the **[9Proxy website](https://9proxy.com)** and logging into your account. If you donâ€™t have one yet, you can easily create a new one. Keep your login credentials handy for the following steps.

### Step 2: Purchase the Right Proxy Pack

Once you're logged in, you'll need to choose and purchase a proxy pack that suits your needs. 9Proxy offers various plans based on the number of proxies and bandwidth you require. Once youâ€™ve made your choice, complete the purchase.

### Step 3: Install the 9Proxy App and Antidetect Browser

To effectively manage your proxies, youâ€™ll need to install the **9Proxy app** and an **antidetect browser**. These browsers help mask your identity and rotate proxies seamlessly.

1. **Download and install the 9Proxy app** from the website.
2. **Install an antidetect browser** like **Multilogin** or **Ghost Browser**, which is compatible with 9Proxy. These browsers allow you to manage multiple sessions while rotating proxies.

### Step 4: Log Into Your 9Proxy App

Open the **9Proxy app** after installation and log in with your account credentials. This will allow you to control your proxies and configure rotation settings.

### Step 5: Choose Your Proxy

Within the 9Proxy app, select the proxy you want to use for your YouTube viewing. You can even select proxies based on specific locations to make your views appear as if theyâ€™re coming from different regions.

### Step 6: Forward the Proxy to a Port and Copy Its Address

Once youâ€™ve selected your proxy, youâ€™ll need to forward it to a port:

1. **Forward the proxy to a specific port** in the 9Proxy app.
2. **Copy the proxy address** and port details to use in the next step.

### Step 7: Set the Proxy Rotation Frequency

In the **9Proxy app**, go to the **settings** section and configure how often the proxy should rotate:

1. Choose whether you want the proxy to rotate after a certain amount of time or after each request.
2. Adjust the settings to simulate natural user behavior and avoid detection.

**Why Do You Need to Set the Time to Rotate the Proxy?*

You need to set the time to rotate the proxy because YouTube counts a view only if the video is watched for more than 30 seconds. By rotating the proxy at regular intervals, you can simulate the behavior of different users watching the video without triggering YouTube's anti-bot measures. This way, each view appears to come from a unique user and maintains the natural flow of engagement.

If you donâ€™t rotate the proxy and keep the same IP address watching the video for too long, YouTube might flag your activity as suspicious. Rotating the proxy ensures that your views appear legitimate and are counted, helping to boost the videoâ€™s visibility and reach.

### Step 8: Configure the Antidetect Browser with the Proxy

Now, itâ€™s time to set up the antidetect browser to use the proxy:

1. Open your antidetect browser.
2. Go to the **proxy settings** section.
3. Paste the proxy address and port information that you copied earlier.

This will allow the antidetect browser to use the rotating proxy and simulate multiple users watching the video.

### Step 9: Start Streaming Your Idolâ€™s Music Video

Now that your proxy and antidetect browser are configured, itâ€™s time to boost your views:

1. Go to YouTube and navigate to your idolâ€™s **music video**.
2. Begin streaming the video while the antidetect browser rotates your proxy IP at the frequency you set. This will ensure that the views come from multiple different IP addresses, making the activity appear organic and safe.

## Tips for Safe and Effective Proxy Use

To make sure your proxy usage is safe and effective, follow these best practices:

* **Donâ€™t Overdo It**: Gradually increase views over time instead of generating a huge spike all at once. YouTubeâ€™s algorithms can flag sudden activity.
* **Engage with the Content**: Donâ€™t just watch the videoâ€”like it, comment on it, and share it. This kind of interaction signals YouTube that the video is gaining organic popularity.
* **Monitor Progress**: Use **YouTube Analytics** to track your views, watch time, and engagement to ensure your strategy is working as expected.

## Conclusion

If YouTube isn't counting your views, donâ€™t let that stop you from showing support for your idolâ€™s music. With **9Proxyâ€™s rotating proxies**, you can safely and effectively increase views without risking penalties. By following the steps outlined above, you can simulate organic user behavior and boost your favorite music videoâ€™s views in a way that YouTubeâ€™s algorithms will accept.
